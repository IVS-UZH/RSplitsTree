\title{Convert an object to SplitsTree-compatible NEXUS input
and launch SplitsTree if required}
\usage{
splitstree(dist, nexus.file = NULL, plot = FALSE,
  splitstree.path = getOption("splitstree.path", NULL))
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{A distance object (usually of class 'dist')}

\item{nexus.file}{A name of the file where the NEXUS file will be written to (see notes)}

\item{plot}{Set this to 'PDF' or 'SVG' to automatically invoke SplitsTree4 and generate a graphics file}

\item{splitstree.path}{Path to the SplitsTree4 binary (see notes)}
}
\value{
The name of the generated NEXUS file
}
\description{
Convert an object to SplitsTree-compatible NEXUS input
and launch SplitsTree if required
}
\note{
If the name of the output file (\code{nexus.file}) is omitted, the function attempts to derive
the file name automatically. Beware that if the file with this name already exists, it will be 
overwritten without a warning â€” so extra care needs to be taken if you have extra `.nex` files 
in the output directory.

If you are generating graphical output, the \code{splitstree.path} neeeds to point to the
command-line
executable of the SplitsTree4 package. The location and name of the executable is system- and 
installation-dependent. The package attempts to guess the standard location for your system, but
if it fails, please provide the path explicitly. Note that on as OS X, a suitable executable is
located within the SpltisTree.app application bundle, with the path
`SplitsTree.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub` (or alternatively, you can install the Linux 
SplitsTree4 package on Mac to get an executable in /usr/local/bin/SplitsTree)
